# Ayosi

Ayosi is a very basic, experimental inversion of control container library written in c#. 

## Plans
* Lifetime options(Scoped, Singleton, Transient )
* Fluent Method Chaining like Linq methods etc(.Where(...).ToList()) 
* Builder Pattern using while creating container
* Locking and Caching technics at registered services (ConcurrentDictionary using)
* Benchmarking with other libraries(autofac,castle) 
* Adding Build pipeline like travisci
* Nuget package creating
